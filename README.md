# gatsby-workshop

Continuing on the LUUPPI/FUTURICE React-workshop project. Aiming to have a proper react-gatsby based portfolio.

## Development environment

First make sure you have Node/npm and gatsby-cli installed on your machine:
```
# installs gatsby-cli globally on your machine
# not really required, since gatsby is a dependency in the project,
# but will be required if you want to start a new gatsby project with 'gatsby new my-project'
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

Then navigate to project root and run:
```
npm install
gatsby develop
```

To test build locally:
```
gatsby build
gatsby serve
```
