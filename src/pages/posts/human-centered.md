This was a study project at TUT. I was working as a part of an international group. Our goal was to further develop Visualisti team management tool with Contextual inquiry process.

We interviewed potential users and did contextual inquiry ie. in a local video production company's ideation session.

We produced consolidated models of the information we gatherd and eventually build an affinity diagram to summary and rationalize all the data. With that data we build UI-proposal and a semi-functional prototype. We presented our final product to the professors and a class.

__What I learned:__ The whole process of contextual inquiry was very interesting to me: inquiries, building models and the affinity diagram as a team. Most useful learning was how to act in a unfamiliar work environment as an observer. You have to be respectful and subtle. The users need to know that you are thankful to be able to observe them in a non judgemental way. An outsider can create unneccessry tension and that can affect the work and the inquiry results. Observer's responsibility is to defuse any possible tension.
