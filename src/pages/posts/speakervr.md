This was a very successful project part of my Master's degree. Our three member team designed and partly implemented a virtual reality application to help overcome challenges of public speaking.

What did we design:
* VR application to help train public speaking and overcome related anxiety. You could interact with the VR environment with your hand gestures.

* Interactive environment where user can change presentation slides and get advice from "Tutor". 360-video audience with occasional eye-contact events.

* Relaxing preparation scene, where user can collect he/her's thoughts and review pre downloaded slides.

We shared the experience of great teamwork. Everyone took part in the designing meetings. Beside that everyone had personal focus. I took responsibility of the mockup implementation.

What was implemented in the mockup:
* Unity application for modern VR-Headsets. Interaction was build with Leap Motion Controller hand gestures.

*  Relaxing starting scene with 360 still image and ambient sounds.

* Public speaking training scene with 360-video audience and ambient sounds. Speaker box with buttons to change slides on the screen. Advising tutor that was controlled with moderator. Tutor gave advice like "Make more eye-contact with audience" or "Time is running low".

Mockup was tested with usability tests to validate our desing. Users were pleased to used the application and reported that they could see benefits using the app in their public speaking. It also turned out that already the mockup version caused stress in the users that were nervous about public speaking. This successfully validated the concept.

We found many potential future development ideas and decided to continue to develop the application after finishing the course.

__Skills I've learned:__ Unity, Leap Motion SDK, Virtual Reality
